* Payments domain is one of the largest fields in which Fintech is at the forefront. It is essentially how technology can assist the movement of money to be more swift, secure and accurate with minimal to no cost and effort. The Payments Ecosystem is made up of Acquirers & Processors, Payment Networks, Issuers, Gateway & Facilitators and ISOs, MSPS, ISVS, & VARS. In today’s digitised world, we are seeing a significant shift from cash and checks to digital/online payment methods. A few trends as well as innovations in this field- 
_Innovative payment products_- The rise in contactless payments. The use of smartphones as digital wallets and can also be used to make payments has become very popular. This has also extended to smart-watches and smart-speakers.  
_Need for stronger security_- As online transactions are prone to cyberattacks, there is a growing interest in cybersecurity. Therefore the use of AI and ML systems to detect and prevent fraudulent payments has been a key factor. Additionally there is also a Customer Authentication process to add another layer of security. Technologies such as biometric fingerprints and facial recognition being important features for online payment security
_Integrated Payments_- Merchants are now integrating payment services online to offer seamless checkout experience for customers. THis allows communication between the customer’s banks to execute a transaction with consent. 
*A few notable companies in this field are PayPal, Square, Afterpay, ApplePay, checkout.com, Fiserv, Stripe, Mollie and Ripple

* Some of the core success metrics for fintech companies may include, Customer satisfaction, Number of referrals or customer recommendations, Revenue growth targets and Churn. 
* Dailypay’s performance against these success metrics prove to be quite successful.

They have also achieved a successful funding round of $500m in May this year which we can rightly assume will assist an exponential growth in revenue. 

* Dailypay is proving to be the leader in On-demand pay amongst its competitors.

## Recommendations
* A recommendation for future consideration or implementation would be using blockchain technology. There are a number of reasons why this may be useful for example using smart contracts (which is a decentralized platform in which applications can run exactly as programmed with any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference). Dailypay can utilise smart contracts to bypass regulations and lower costs for common financial transactions. 
* Additional technologies could be programming software tools that allow developers to create blockchain, such as Python. 
* Blockchain technology is inexpensive when compared to other technologies which assist with minimising costs for Fintech companies to reach a higher bottom line. Blockchain has also improved efficiency, in better security, intermediary removal and overall better processes. Companies that are already using blockchain include Amazon, SAP and Oracle, which provides validation to the benefits of blockchain with already successful companies using it.
